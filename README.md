## Filesystem notes

The filesystem structure follows ostree specifications:

- The `/usr` directory is read-only, with all changes managed by the container image.
- The `/etc` directory is editable, but any changes applied in the container image will be transferred to the node unless the file was modified locally.
- Changes to `/var` (including /var/home) are made during the first boot. Afterwards, `/var` remains untouched.

As recommended by the bootc project, prioritise using `/usr` and use `/etc` as a fallback if needed.

Please note that a configuration file in `/etc` drifts when it is modified locally. Consequently, bootc will no longer manage this file, and new releases wonâ€™t be transferred to your installation. While this might be desired in some cases, it can also lead to issues.
Use `ostree admin config-diff` to list the files in your local /etc that are no longer managed by bootc, because they are modified or added.

> If a particular configuration file needs to be managed by bootc, you can revert it by copying the version created by the container build from `/usr/etc` to `/etc`

## Setup remote access on client

```sh
# ~/.ssh/config
Host portableinfo.pinggy
  HostName portableinfo.a.pinggy.link
  User cthtrifork
  Port 21412
  SetEnv TERM=xterm-256color
```

Connect to a different host through pinggy:

```sh
ssh -J portableinfo.pinggy cthtrifork@192.168.1.136
```
